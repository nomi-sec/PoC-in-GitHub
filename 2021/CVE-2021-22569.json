Reporter: OSS-Fuzz  Affected versions: All versions of Java Protobufs (including Kotlin and JRuby) prior to the versions listed below. Protobuf \"javalite\" users (typically Android) are not affected.  Severity CVE-2021-22569 High - CVSS Score: 7.5, An implementation weakness in how unknown fields are parsed in Java. A small (~800 KB) malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent, repeated GC pauses.  Proof of Concept For reproduction details, please refer to the oss-fuzz issue that identifies the specific inputs that exercise this parsing weakness.  Remediation and Mitigation Please update to the latest available versions of the following packages:  protobuf-java (3.16.1, 3.18.2, 3.19.2) protobuf-kotlin (3.18.2, 3.19.2) google-protobuf [JRuby gem only] (3.19.2) References GHSA-wrvw-hg22-4m67 https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2021-22569 https:\/\/bugs.chromium.org\/p\/oss-fuzz\/issues\/detail?id=39330 https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/support\/bulletins#gcp-2022-001",
